<div class="intro-text">
    <p>I'm an experienced <a href="https://odoo.com">Odoo</a> developer since 2016, 
        passionate about designing clean, modular, and production-ready business applications.</p>

    <p><b><a href="https://github.com/nasares">Nasares</a></b> is my digital lab where I explore ideas 
        around lean tech stacks (Flask, SQLite, no-JS), automation and AI.</p>

    <p>I prototype and share tools that <a href="/projects">you can discover here</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Why This blog ?</b></p>

    <p>First of all, because I like writing <a href="/blog">to share my knowledge</a> and this is why I blog since 2010.</p>

    <p>I have a <a href="https://nasares.github.io">digital garden</a> where I solve my pain points with small and focused tools : 
        I need peoples and businesses to use them and solve their problems.</p>

    <p>You can know more <a href="{{ '/now/' | relative_url }}">about me here</a> and <a href="{{ '/tools/' | relative_url }}">what I'm doing now</a>.</p>
